# OpenWeatherMap_API
Open Weather Map API  Personal 
This project is a cross-platform mobile weather application developed using the Flutter framework. The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate modern mobile app development practices such as MVVM architecture, Provider state management, REST API integration, and user-friendly UI/UX design.

The application connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather information and forecast data. Users can search for cities, view weather details, check future forecasts, and manage a list of favorite cities using CRUD operations.

The project was developed as part of the Mobile Application Development coursework to showcase skills in Flutter development, clean architecture, asynchronous programming, and responsive UI design.
